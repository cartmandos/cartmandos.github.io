<!--
8. On the "About" page, create a section that includes the following information: describe why
you are interested in coding, your educational and career experiences, and your personal
interests. Please style and layout the page as you choose.

9. Add another section below what you created in the previous step. In this section, write where
you were born and the cities in which you have visited. There should be at least 3 cities in
total. If you have visited two cities or less, complete the list with other cities you would like to
visit.

10. Add two buttons: "Previous" and "Next" below the map. Clicking the "Next" button should
change the pointer to the next city listed on your about page (i.e., a city you have lived in or
want to visit). When the first of the series of locations is selected, the "Previous" button should
disappear or be disabled, and when the last location is selected, the "Next" button should be
the one blocked. Otherwise, both buttons should be visible. We encourage you to implement
this using only one iframe.

To summarize the behaviour of points 9 and 10, please give a look to the animation
provided inside the examples folder, under the filename maps_behavior.gif.
